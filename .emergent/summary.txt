**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, JSX, React Hooks (, , ).
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with Flexbox, Grid, and media queries for responsiveness. Key concepts include clamp for fluid typography, custom properties (variables) for theming, and keyframe animations.
- **Data**: Frontend-only with mock data stored in a separate JS file.
- **Tooling**:  for React scripts,  for process management.

**key DB schema**
- No new database schema has been implemented. The backend part of the lead capture form is pending.

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx**: Created and extensively modified. Contains the entire structure and logic for the landing page.
-   **/app/frontend/src/styles/landing.css**: Created and extensively modified. Contains all custom styles, animations, and responsive media queries for the landing page.
-   **/app/frontend/src/data/mock.js**: Created and updated. Provides all the text and numerical data for the villas and amenities displayed on the page.
-   **/app/contracts.md**: Created and updated. Documents the plan for backend integration, specifically the form submission endpoint and webhook.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Modified to render the  component at the root route.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.css**: Modified to import the 'Poppins' font from Google Fonts.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file is over 1000 lines long. While functional, it could be split into smaller, more manageable files for better organization in the future, but it is not a priority.

**key api endpoints**
-   **Planned**: A  endpoint to receive form data and trigger the webhook.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly detail-oriented and provides iterative visual feedback. Await explicit approval before moving to backend implementation.
-   The next major step is backend development. The  file outlines the requirements for the form submission endpoint and webhook integration.
-   The webhook URL is .
-   Remember to respond in **Spanish**.
